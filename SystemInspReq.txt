Here's a detailed requirements, features, and enablers document for both tools:

# systemRecord

## Core Requirements
1. Create system fingerprints before and after application installation
2. Generate SHA256 hashes of specified files and directories
3. Archive selected files for comparison
4. Package all data into a tar project file
5. Configuration-driven path selection
6. Containerized deployment

## Functional Features
1. File System Analysis
   - Recursive directory scanning
   - File hash generation
   - File metadata collection (permissions, ownership, timestamps)
   - Symbolic link handling
   - File type detection

2. Configuration Management
   - YAML-based configuration file
   - Path inclusion/exclusion patterns
   - Archive selection rules
   - Ignore patterns
   - Maximum file size limits

3. Data Collection
   - File fingerprinting (SHA256)
   - Full file archiving for selected paths
   - Directory structure recording
   - File metadata capture

4. Output Generation
   - Structured tar project file
   - JSON manifest file
   - Operation logs
   - Error reporting

## Technical Enablers
1. Python Libraries
   - os, sys for file system operations
   - hashlib for SHA256 generation
   - tarfile for project packaging
   - yaml for configuration parsing
   - logging for operation logging
   - argparse for CLI arguments

2. Docker Components
   - Python base image
   - Volume mounting for system access
   - Configuration file mounting
   - Output directory mounting

# systemDiff

## Core Requirements
1. Compare two systemRecord project files
2. Web-based interface for viewing differences
3. Text file diff visualization
4. Summary reports of system changes
5. Containerized deployment

## Functional Features
1. Project Analysis
   - tar project file parsing
   - JSON manifest comparison
   - Change detection (new/modified/deleted files)
   - Binary file change detection

2. Web Interface
   - Project upload mechanism
   - Interactive file browser
   - Diff viewer for text files
   - Change summary dashboard
   - File metadata comparison
   - Search and filter capabilities

3. Reporting
   - Change statistics
   - Modified file lists
   - New file lists
   - Deleted file lists
   - Exportable reports (CSV, PDF)

## Technical Enablers
1. Backend (Python)
   - Flask/FastAPI for REST API
   - difflib for text comparison
   - tarfile for project handling
   - JSON processing

2. Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)
   - React/Vue.js framework
   - Monaco editor for diff viewing
   - Bootstrap for styling
   - Axios for API communication
   - Chart.js for visualizations

3. Docker Components
   - Multi-stage build
   - Nginx for static content
   - Python backend service
   - Volume mounting for persistent storage

## Common Requirements
1. Security
   - Input validation
   - File size limits
   - Secure file handling
   - Error handling

2. Performance
   - Large file handling
   - Efficient diff algorithms
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Memory management

3. Documentation
   - Installation guide
   - User manual
   - API documentation
   - Configuration reference

4. Testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Docker deployment tests
   - Performance benchmarks
